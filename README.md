### Steps to be done ->
```
- Since GIT LFS is installed in the project, it needs to be cloned.
       ❛ After the project opens, switch to the SplashScreen scene.
       ❛ After pressing the Play button, the game will be playable.

- There is a settings button in the game, if you have a problem you can manually finish the level from there.
- The project has been tested with an external clone and there are no problems with opening and playing the project, if you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact.
- Project tested on "Device Simulator - Apple Iphone 13 Pro Max", I recommend playing on this device to get the best result, but you can also get similar performance on other devices.

- As an extra feature, you can undo by clicking on the answer boxes above the game.
